# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Implementation Project

## üìå Business Case
Protect organizational endpoints from malware, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats through the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). This implementation aims to reduce risk, streamline remediation, and integrate endpoint security into the broader enterprise security strategy.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Deploy MDE to all eligible endpoints across the enterprise
- Automate threat detection and remediation using Microsoft tools and scripting
- Integrate MDE with Microsoft 365 Defender and other security platforms
- Educate users and IT teams on endpoint security practices

## üßæ Licensing Requirements

| License Type                         | Features                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (P1)   | Core prevention and detection capabilities                               |
| Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 (P2)   | Threat & vulnerability management, EDR, automation, advanced hunting     |
| Microsoft 365 E5                    | Includes MDE P2 licensing                                                |
| M365 E3 + Add-on                    | Requires separate Defender P2 add-on                                     |

**Notes:**
- Inventory endpoint types (Windows, macOS, Linux) to align license model
- Servers require separate licensing via Defender for Servers (Defender for Cloud)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define scope, objectives, timeline, and success metrics

2. **Assessment & Inventory**
   - Audit devices, applications, and existing endpoint protection solutions

3. **Licensing Setup**
   - Determine and assign appropriate licenses across the org

4. **Onboarding Plan**
   - Choose method: Intune, GPO, Config Manager, or scripts
   - Define pilot group and rollout phases

5. **Baseline Configuration**
   - Configure ASR rules, EDR settings, telemetry levels, auto-remediation

6. **Integration**
   - Connect MDE with Defender for Identity, Sentinel, and Compliance Center

7. **Training & Documentation**
   - Deliver training to SecOps and IT
   - Provide self-help docs for end users

8. **Automation**
   - Deploy PowerShell scripts for health scans and remediation
   - Configure alert suppression and escalation rules

9. **Security Testing**
   - Simulate threats using Microsoft attack tools
   - Validate logs, alerts, and analyst workflows

10. **Deployment**
    - Expand MDE to all in-scope devices in scheduled waves

11. **Post-Deployment Review**
    - Gather feedback, review incident reports, refine policy settings

12. **Ongoing Optimization**
    - Tune alerts, review logs, update policies quarterly
